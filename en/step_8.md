## Display pollution data with your Dashboard

### Program your slider to display the fuel emissions level

At the moment your slider is running off of random integers between -175 and 175. (We don't go to 180 as it can cause problems with travel around a full rotation.) We picked these numbers because they are the motor's limits of travel in each direction. The data coming in from your API won't have this same range - we need to make it fit the motor.

**Calibrating** the indicator will mean mapping the maximum and minimum possible data values from your API between -175째 and 175째 on your motor. The highest possible reading will be at 175째, while the lowest possible reading will be at -175째. 

For example: if it's displaying the Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) level, the minimum and maximum possible reading on your slider will depend on where you live. The minimum reading possible is obviously 0, and we will want to consider what the normal range for what we are attempting to measure and add a bit to that: for NO2, this will be around 0.3. (Any more than that, and you're in the danger zone!)

In a new Thonny window, type the following:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: data_dash.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 1
line_highlights: 
---
from buildhat import Motor
from time import sleep


motor_no2 = Motor('A')
no2_min_value = 0 # the lowest NO2 reading you think you will get (This should hopefully be around 0)
no2_max_value = 0.3 #the highest NO2 reading you think you will get (This shouldn't be more than 0.3)
no2_min_angle = -175
no2_max_angle = 175

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

The next part we will write will do some clever maths to map our data range across the motor range. (It's basically the same as the function used in the [LEGO Data Plotter project](https://learning-admin.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/lego-plotter/6).)
 
--- task ---

Add this function beneath your existing code:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: data_dash.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 11
line_highlights: 
---
def no2_remap(no2_min_value, no2_max_value, no2_min_angle, no2_max_angle, no2_sensor_data):
    no2_value_range = (no2_max_value - no2_min_value)
    no2_motor_range = (no2_max_angle - no2_min_angle)
    no2_mapped = (((no2_sensor_data - no2_min_value) * no2_motor_range) / no2_value_range) + no2_min_angle
    return int(no2_mapped)
    print(no2_mapped)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

Now that our function has been created, we need to make a loop that will:

+ pull the pollutant data from the API
+ find the angle the motor is currently at
+ move to the new angle to display the reading

--- task ---

Add the following code to the end of your script:

--- code ---
---
language: python
filename: data_dash.py
line_numbers: true
line_number_start: 18
line_highlights: 
---
while True:
    no2_sensor_data  =  API command to pull the data()
    no2_current_angle = motor_no2.get_aposition()
    no2_new_angle = no2_remap(no2_min_value, no2_max_value, no2_min_angle, no2_max_angle, no2_sensor_data)
    sleep(0.5)

--- /code ---

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Save your work as `data_dash.py` and click Run. Your slider should move to display the current NO2 reading.

## Program your gauge to show air pollution level

### Calibrate your gauge

At the moment your gauge is running off of random integers between -175 and 175. Calibrating it will mean mapping the maximum and minimum possible data values from your API between -175 and 175 on your motor. The highest possible reading will be at 175 degrees, while the lowest possible reading will be at -175.

For our example we will measure the **fine particles (PM2.5)** measurement.The term **fine particles**, or particulate matter 2.5 (PM2.5), refers to tiny particles or droplets in the air that are two and a half microns (or less) in width. The particles measured by PM2.5 are what make up smoke and smog.

<p style="border-left: solid; border-width:10px; border-color: #0faeb0; background-color: aliceblue; padding: 10px;">Like inches, meters and miles, a <span style="color: #0faeb0">micron</span> is a unit of measurement for distance. There are about 25,000 microns in an inch. The widths of the larger particles in the PM2.5 size range would be about thirty times smaller than that of a human hair.  These smaller particles are so small that several thousand of them could fit on the full stop at the end of this sentence.</p>

Connect the motor from your gauge to port B on the BuildHAT.

--- /task ---

--- task ---

Change your `data_dash.py` script to match the following, filling in the variables with your own information as you go:

`poll_min_value` is the lowest pm25 air pollution reading you think you will get (This should hopefully be around 0)
`poll_max_value` is the highest pm25 air pollution reading you think you will get (The maximum possible is 100, but more than about 65 and you'll have trouble seeing!)
