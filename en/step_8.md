## What next?

You could quite easily add a third motor to your dashboard, or create an LED bar graph to display other data from OpenAQ, but now you know how to represent data using LEGO® indicators, you can use your new data dashboard to show almost anything!

Some possible sources you can use for new data to show on your dashboard:

+ If you make YouTube videos, you could use the [YouTube Developer API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
+ Fortnite players can access their [player data](https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api)
+ You could display the [weather on Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/), thanks to NASA!
+ Display data related to the [COVID pandemic](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API)
+ Or, connect your Fitbit up to your dashboard using the [Fitbit API](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/) and track your workouts!

If you've completed all the LEGO® projects and want to have more fun exploring Python, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python).
