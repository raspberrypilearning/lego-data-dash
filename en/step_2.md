## Plan your dashboard

Use this step to plan your dashboard, and think about what information you want to display. You can plan by just thinking, tinkering, drawing, writing, or however you like! 

We will use an example API in this project from OpenAQ to demonstrate how to create and use your data dashboard, but you could use any API you want. (There are some more API links in the final step for you to look at if you'd like to try it with a different data source.)

### Why are you making a dashboard?

--- task ---

**Think** about the purpose of your dashboard:

+ What information will it display?
+ How will it show this information to the user?
+ What layout will it have, to make it easy to read?

--- /task ---

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your dashboard for (your **audience**):

+ What symbols or scales will make it obvious what you are displaying?
+ How will the user get current data?
+ Will they prefer bright colours and lights, or simple and clean designs?
+ Where will they keep it? Will it fit there?

--- /task ---

### Get started

--- task ---

Use a pen and paper to plan ideas for your dashboard:

+ Consider how many motors you will have available to you to power the indicators — you need one motor for each indicator
+ Will you use other components in your build, like LEDs, buzzers, or buttons? What will they do?
+ How will your different indicators and inputs fit together into a frame?
+ What LEGO elements will you need to build it?

Draw your dashboard now, including the frame to hold it and any indicators you would like to create or user inputs needed. Label them with the information they will display or the input they provide.

In the next step, you will construct some readouts for your dashboard using LEGO®!
