## Plan your dashboard

Use this step to plan your Dashboard, and think about what information you want to display. You can plan by just thinking; tinkering; drawing or writing; or however you like! 

The APIs shown in this project are huge repositories of data stored online, specifically made for people like you to access. They contain all sorts of useful and interesting data. Let's have a look now at what the example APIs can tell you:

API 1 is called NAME, and it stores worldwide data on TOPIC. You can use it to LIST OF IDEAS AND DATASETS

API 2 is called NAME, and it stores worldwide data on TOPIC. You can use it to LIST OF IDEAS AND DATASETS

API 3 is called NAME, and it stores worldwide data on TOPIC. You can use it to LIST OF IDEAS AND DATASETS

### Why are you making a Dashboard?

--- task ---

**Think** about the purpose of your Dashboard:

+ What information will it display?
+ How will it show this information to the user?
+ What layout will it have, to make it easy to read?

--- /task ---

### Who is it for?

--- task ---

Think about who you will make your Dashboard for (your **audience**):

+ What symbols or scales will make it obvious what you are displaying?
+ How will the user get current data?
+ Will they prefer bright colours and lights, or simple and clean designs?
+ Where will they keep it? Will it fit there?

### Get started

--- task ---

Use a pen and paper to plan ideas for your Dashboard:

+ Consider how many motors you will have available to you to power the indicators - you need one motor for each indicator.
+ Will you use other components in your build, like LEDs, buzzers or buttons? What will they do?
+ How will your different indicators and inputs fit together into a frame?
+ What LEGO elements will you need to build it?

Draw your dashboard now, including the frame to hold it, and any indicators you would like to create or user inputs. Label them with the information they will display or the input they provide.

In the next step, we will start building with LEGO!
