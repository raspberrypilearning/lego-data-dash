## Make a LEGO gauge

Another way to quickly display data is using **dials**, also known as **gauges**. You've definitely seen them before, they are usually round or semicircular and have two main visible parts:

+ The face, which has the scale shown on it
+ The needle, which moves along the scale to display the data reading

A gauge or dial is the simplest type of data readout you can create using LEGO, as it only relies upon creating the face and needle. Because the needle connects directly to your motor, the build is very simple:

### Create a scale
To finish building the gauge, you will need to create a scale using paper, card or other art supplies. The mechanics and coding are exactly the same, but think now about how you would like your gauge to look.

 **Choose** what kind of dial you will make. 
 
 There are two simple types we can create with LEGO:

+ A gauge where the needle spins to indicate a point on the face:

+ A gauge where the whole face turns to display a point at the top with a stationary indicator:

On a blank piece of paper, trace a neat circle the size you would like your gauge to be. Mark the centre, and cut it out using scissors.

Split the circle into equal segments (one for each reading) by drawing lines through the centre, or draw your scale around the edge.

Draw an icon or write inside each segment what it indicates.

Once you have finished creating your gauge face, you will need to mount it to your dashboard.

To finish building your needle gauge:

--- task ---

Slide the face down over your axle, using blue tac or tape to stick it down to the dash behind and prevent it from sliding as the axle turns.

Add a 90 degree elbow to the end of your axle and place another axle into it. Make sure it is long enough to reach your scale and clearly indicate the readings.

If you are creating a spinning face dial, you should mount a single gear behind your face, to prevent it from catching on your dashboard:
