## Make a LEGO gauge

Another way to quickly display data is using **dials**, also known as **gauges**. You've definitely seen them before, they are usually round or semicircular and have two main visible parts:

+ The face, which has the scale shown on it
+ The needle, which moves along the scale to display the data reading

A gauge or dial is the simplest type of data readout you can create using LEGO, as it only relies upon creating the face and needle. Because the needle connects directly to your motor, the build is very simple:

### Create a scale
To create a scale for your gauge, you will need to consider what kind of dial it will be. There are two types we can create with LEGO:

+ A gauge where the needle spins to indicate a point on the face:

+ A gauge where the whole face turns to display a point at the top with a stationary indicator:
