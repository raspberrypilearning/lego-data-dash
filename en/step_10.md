## What next?

Now you know how to represent data using LEGO indicators, you can use your new data dashboard to show almost anything!

Some possible sources you can use for new data to show on your dash:

+ If you make YouTube videos, you could use the [YouTube Developer API](https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3)
+ Fortnite players can access their [player data](https://fortnitetracker.com/site-api)
+ You could display the [weather on Mars](https://mars.nasa.gov/insight/weather/), thanks to NASA!
+ Display data related to the [COVID pandemic](https://github.com/M-Media-Group/Covid-19-API)
+ or connect your Fitbit up to your sash using the [Fitbit API](https://dev.fitbit.com/build/reference/web-api/)

If you've completed all the LEGO Spark projects and want to have more fun exploring Python, then you could try out any of [these projects](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects?software%5B%5D=python).
