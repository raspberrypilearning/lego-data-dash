## Accessing your chosen API

API is the acronym for **Application Programming Interface**, which is software that allows two applications to talk to each other. Each time you use an app like Facebook, send an instant message, or check the weather on your phone, youâ€™re using an API. 

For example, when you use an app on your phone; the app connects to the Internet and sends data about what you want to know to a server. The server then finds and retrieves the data you want, interprets it and sends it back to your phone. The app then takes that data that has been returned and presents you with the information you wanted in a readable way. This is what an API is - all of this happens through the **API**.

The cool part is; we can write our own apps that investigate online databases of information and return them to our LEGO data dashboard instead of a phone - we'll use our Raspberry Pi as the brains to get that data, then display it on our hand made LEGO indicators!
